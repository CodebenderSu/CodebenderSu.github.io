## Professional Portfolio Site
This is my professional portfolio featuring past projects, contact information, and general information about me. It isn't uploaded to a repository for redistribution, but rather so that it may be hosted on GitHub pages as a free website that is also just convenient. I'm really frugal like that.

## Dependencies
Dependencies are listed for posterity, so future me won't just forget what this app requires.
